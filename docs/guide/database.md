# Database (PostgreSQL)

Langfuse uses PostgreSQL as its primary data store. The operator supports three modes: **CloudNativePG**, **external**, and **managed**.

::: tip
Exactly one of `cloudnativepg`, `external`, or `managed` must be configured.
:::

::: warning Production guidance
For production workloads use **CloudNativePG** (HA, streaming replication, point-in-time recovery, barman/pgbackrest backups) or an **external** managed Postgres (RDS, Cloud SQL, Aiven, etc.). The operator does not manage HA or backups for any other Postgres deployment.
:::

## CloudNativePG

Reference an existing [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) cluster:

```yaml
spec:
  database:
    cloudnativepg:
      clusterRef:
        name: pg-cluster
        namespace: databases    # optional, defaults to instance namespace
      database: langfuse        # default: langfuse
```

The operator reads connection credentials from the CNPG-generated secret `<cluster-name>-app`.

## External

Connect to any PostgreSQL instance by providing a connection URL in a Secret:

```yaml
spec:
  database:
    external:
      secretRef:
        name: langfuse-db
        keys:
          url: database_url
          directUrl: direct_url   # optional, bypasses connection pooling
```

The Secret should contain the full PostgreSQL connection string:

```
postgresql://user:password@host:5432/langfuse?sslmode=require
```

**A `/` or `?` in the password must be percent-encoded** (`%2F`, `%3F`). Both characters end the URL's authority, so they hide the host from every parser — Prisma's and the operator's alike. A `#` needs encoding too (`%23`): Prisma reads it as the start of a fragment.

An `@` does **not** need encoding, and neither does a `:`. Prisma takes the last `@` in the authority as the credential separator, as do the migration Job's init container and the operator's health probe, so `postgres://user:pa@ss@host:5432/db` connects normally. Encoding it as `%40` is also fine — just not required.

The optional `directUrl` key bypasses connection poolers like PgBouncer. Langfuse's Prisma datasource declares `directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")` and `prisma migrate deploy` prefers it when set, so when you provide it, **that** is the endpoint migrations run against — the `url` only serves the application.

For the same reason the Secret's name and the `url`/`directUrl` key names are part of the instance's datastore target, and changing them after migrations have run is refused. The values behind the keys are not, so credential rotation is free. See [Changing the datastore target](../reference/langfuseinstance.md#changing-the-datastore-target).

## Managed (deprecated)

::: danger Rejected since 0.10.0, removed in 0.11.0
`database.managed` was never implemented — the operator does not deploy PostgreSQL in this mode, and it wired `DATABASE_URL` to a Secret key nothing creates, so the pods could only fail with `CreateContainerConfigError`.

Since **0.10.0** the operator rejects it outright with a `Ready=False` / `ConfigError` condition rather than producing broken pods. It is removed entirely in **0.11.0**.

Use [`cloudnativepg`](#cloudnativepg) for an operator-managed HA PostgreSQL, or [`external`](#external) for a managed service.

## Migrations

Database migrations are configured under `database.migration`:

```yaml
spec:
  database:
    migration:
      runOnDeploy: true            # run migrations on every reconcile (default: true)
      backgroundMigrations:
        enabled: true              # monitor background migrations (default: true)
        timeout: "3600s"           # max wait time
```

When `runOnDeploy` is true, the operator creates a Kubernetes Job with the new image to run `prisma migrate deploy` before updating the Web and Worker Deployments.
